# TITLE: Atomic Habits

## Key Principles
- Tiny, consistent improvements (1% better every day) compound into significant transformation
- Identity-based habits: focus on who you want to become, not just outcomes
- Systems over goals: design the environment and process rather than obsess over outcomes
- Habit loop: Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward (Four Laws of Behavior Change)
