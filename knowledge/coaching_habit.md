# TITLE: The Coaching Habit

## Key Principles
- Build a habit of short, powerful coaching conversations
- Ask more, tell less; help people learn rather than giving advice

## Techniques & Playbooks (Seven Questions)
1) Kickstart: "What's on your mind?"
2) AWE: "And what else?"
3) Focus: "What's the real challenge here for you?"
4) Foundation: "What do you want?"
5) Lazy: "How can I help?"
6) Strategic: "If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?"
7) Learning: "What was most useful for you?"

## When to use
- Time-limited conversations; building autonomy; avoiding over-functioning

## Example
Kickstart + Focus: "What's on your mind? ... What's the real challenge here for you?"

## Keywords
