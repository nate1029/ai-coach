## Techniques & Playbooks
- OARS: Open Questions, Affirmations, Reflections, Summaries
  - When to use: early dialogue to build rapport and surface intrinsic motivation
- Elicit Change Talk: prompt client's own reasons for change
  - When to use: when ambivalence or resistance appears
- Agenda Mapping: co-create focus areas while respecting autonomy
  - When to use: at the start to set structure without being directive
