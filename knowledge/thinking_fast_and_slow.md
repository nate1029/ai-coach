# TITLE: Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman)

## Key Principles
- Two systems: System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, analytical)
- Biases arise from heuristics: overconfidence, loss aversion, anchoring, availability, etc.

## Techniques & Playbooks
- Awareness of Biases: pause and reframe automatic thoughts
  - When to use: when decisions feel reactive or emotional
- Use System 2 Strategically: slow down important decisions with structure
  - When to use: for major life or habit decisions

## Example
Prompt: "Pause â€” what's your gut saying? Now list two reasons for and against."

## Keywords
system 1, system 2, biases, overconfidence, heuristics, decision-making
