- **Phase 2**: Goal Setting and Ideal Self definition

- **Phase 4**: Daily Execution and Accountability

### 2. **Multiple API Calls Strategy with Guardrails**
Instead of single API calls, the system now uses, with guardrails to prevent endless questioning:
- **First API Call**: Analyze personality from user responses
- **Second API Call**: Generate personalized daily plans
- **Third API Call**: Create contextual accountability responses
  - Enforces one question per reply
  - Respects stop intents and caps deep-dive follow-ups

### 3. **Personality-Driven Coaching**
- Dynamic question generation based on responses
- Pattern recognition for personality traits
- Communication style adaptation
- Personalized task recommendations

### 4. **Enhanced Daily Task Management**
- 3-4 tasks per day (physical, emotional, mental)
- Personality-based task selection
- Progress tracking and streak maintenance
- Morning check-ins and evening reflections

### 5. **Lightweight RAG Support**
- Optional retrieval from `knowledge/` for coach best practices
- Size-limited context injection for low latency

## üîÑ Conversation Flow Example

### Initial Interaction
```
User: "Hey, I'm Nathic"
Bot: "Hey! I'm Catalyst, your AI coach. What was the highlight of your past week?"
```

### Personality Assessment
```
User: "This week I played tennis and worked on my startup"
Bot: "That's interesting, you mentioned tennis and startup work. Do you find any connection between sports and your entrepreneurial mindset?"
```

### Goal Setting
```
Bot: "Based on what I've learned about you, describe your ideal self 5 years from now. Be specific about daily routines, achievements, and how you'll feel."
```

### Daily Execution
```
Bot: "Hey Nathic, how did today's tasks go? Did you complete the tennis practice and gratitude journaling?"
User: "I didn't do the tennis practice"
Bot: "What got in the way? Let's figure out how to make tomorrow better."
```
